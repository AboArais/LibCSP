\chapter{Safety-Critical Java}
\label{chapter:scj}
Having introduced the area of real-time and safety-critical systems, this chapter will introduce Safety-Critical Java. We begin with a general introduction to the programming model through an example, followed by the concept of compliance levels. Next we describe the memory management in SCJ that is different from standard edition Java, and conclude with a brief introduction to the support for external hardware.
 The chapter is primarily based on the SCJ specification draft, dated September 2012\cite{SCJSpec}. We note that changes to the specification may occur after the finalisation of this report.
