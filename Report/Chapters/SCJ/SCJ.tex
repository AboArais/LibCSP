\chapter{Safety-Critical Java}
\label{chapter:scj}
Having introduced the area of real-time and safety-critical systems, this Chapter will introduce Safety-Critical Java. We begin with a general introduction to the programming model through an example, followed by the concept of compliance levels. Next we describe the memory management in SCJ that is different from standard edition Java, and conclude with a brief introduction to how one can use external hardware devices.
At some points along the way, we will compare the various parts to the original RTSJ with the goal of emphasising some of the key differences as well as motivations behind why the work on SCJ was necessary (and similarly, these motivations also apply in general for why Ravenscar Java and Predictable Java were made). The chapter is primarily based on the SCJ specification draft, dated September 2012(cite til spec). We note that changes to the specification may occur after the finalisation of this report.
