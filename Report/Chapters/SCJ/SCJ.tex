\chapter{Safety-Critical Java}
\label{chapter:scj}
Having introduced the area of real-time and safety-critical systems, this Chapter will introduce Safety-Critical Java. We begin with a general introduction to the programming model through an example, followed by the concept of compliance levels. Next we describe the memory management in SCJ that is different from standard edition Java, and conclude with a brief introduction to how one can use external hardware devices. For more details on the underlying model, including motivations behind the design in SCJ and comparison with various parts of RTSJ, we refer to a deeper explanation appended in Appendix \ref{chapter:scheduling}.
 The chapter is primarily based on the SCJ specification draft, dated September 2012(cite til spec). We note that changes to the specification may occur after the finalisation of this report.
