\chapter{Safety-Critical Java}
\label{chapter:scj}
Having introduced the area of real-time and safety-critical systems, this Chapter will introduce Safety-Critical Java in detail. We begin with a general introduction to the programming model and how simple programs are structured, and then dive in to the details of significant parts such as the concurrency and memory model applied. Under way we will compare the various parts to the original RTSJ with the goal of emphasising some of the key differences as well as motivations behind why the work on SCJ was necessary (and similarly, these motivations also apply in general for why Ravenscar Java and Predictable Java were made). The chapter is primarily based on the SCJ specification draft, dated September 2012(cite til spec). We note that changes to the specification may occur after the finalisation of this report.
