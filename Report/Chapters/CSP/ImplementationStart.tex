\section{Implementation}
As with the design, this Section will elaborate on significant extracts of the implementation. Emphasis is put on challenges under the SCJ restrictions and how these are handled. The full source code is available on GitHub\cite{SW902e12:CSPinSCJ}. UML diagrams covering the entire implementation is appended in Appendix \ref{chapter:umlappendix}. Note that element types for e.g. packets are internally postfixed with \textit{Core} in its type name making it become \code{PacketCore}. This is done to hide internal functionality and to expose a clean API from an end-user perspective. Furthermore the library user will only deal with the \code{CSPManager} and the interface types, namely \code{Socket}, \code{Connection} and \code{Packet}. The corresponding elements with the appended \code{Core}, will then implement these interfaces as well as provide extra internal functionality.
