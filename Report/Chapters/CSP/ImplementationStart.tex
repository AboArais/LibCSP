\section{Implementation}
As with the design, this Section will elaborate on significant extracts of the implementation. Emphasis is put on challenges under the SCJ restrictions and how these are handled. The full source code is available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Todberg/SW9/tree/master/Code}}. UML diagrams covering the entire implementation is appended in Appendix \ref{chapter:umlappendix}.
