\section{Implementation}
As with the design, this Section will elaborate on significant extracts of the implementation. Emphasis is put on challenges under the SCJ restrictions and how these are handled. The full source code is available on GitHub\cite{SW902e12:CSPinSCJ}. UML diagrams covering the entire implementation is appended in Appendix \ref{chapter:umlappendix}. Note that element types for e.g. packets are internally postfixed with \textit{Core} in its type name making it become \code{PacketCore}. The public interface types are named \code{Socket}, \code{Connection} and \code{Packet}. These are the interfaces exposed to client applications through the \code{CSPManager}. The elements with the appended \code{Core}, will implements these interfaces as well as provide extra internal functionality. Therefore, any reference to e.g. \code{Socket} refers to the created interface, and \code{SocketCore} refers to the concrete class used internally, that implements the interface.
