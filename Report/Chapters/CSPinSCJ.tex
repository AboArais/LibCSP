\section{The SCJ Implementation (not ready for read)}
The previous client/server example shows some of the basic steps involved in typical socket programming. Moreover with a SCJ implementation, we wish to be able to support this kind of functionality and thereby making communication between multiple hosts in a network possible. However due to time constraints, only a subset of the protocol will be developed. This subset include support for:

\begin{itemize}
	\item UDP transmission of packets between multiple hosts
	\item I2C and the loopback interface
	\item Broadcast traffic
\end{itemize}
