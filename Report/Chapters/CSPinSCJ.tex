\chapter{The CSP in Safety-Critical Java}
\label{chapter:cspinscj}
The previous client/server example shows some of the basic steps involved in typical socket programming. This Chapter will cover the most significant parts of the SCJ implementation with emphasis on the important decisions and challenges encountered under SCJ restrictions. We start with the requirements elicited from studying the original CSP implementation, followed by pre-development decisions. We then describe the actual design and implementation of CSP in SCJ.
