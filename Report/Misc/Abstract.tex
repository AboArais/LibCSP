Recently Java has been targeted the development of safety-critical systems with the new standard, JSR-302 \textit{Safety-Critical Java} (SCJ), to facilitate the development of systems, certifiable with standards such as \textit{DO-178B Level A}. The SCJ specification is still in draft, and lacks implementations and use cases in order to be thoroughly evaluated. 

This report presents a study of SCJ and the application of this for two use cases.
We examine the draft version of the SCJ specification and an implementation of SCJ on the \textit{Java Optimized Processor} (JOP). We take the specification and its implementation on JOP and apply this in the development of safety-critical software in collaboration with GomSpace that specialises in cubesat and nano-satellite platforms. We develop an SCJ version of their \textit{Cubesat Space Protocol} (CSP), a network-layer delivery protocol for cubesats. Furthermore we take this implementation and develop a watchdog module in SCJ that utilises the CSP protocol to monitor other modules in a safety-critical environment and analyse the applicability of SCJ from a theoretical point of view with regard to theory in real-time software such as response-time analysis. The result of this study is an analysis and findings on the applicability of SCJ in its current state for the development of safety-critical systems with emphasis on transitioning ones Java experience to SCJ.
